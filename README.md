   - Positive reviews: helpfulness, accuracy, creativity  
   - Negative reviews: accuracy issues, slow performance, subscription cost  
   - Neutral reviews: feature requests, questions, mixed feedback  

4. **Visualization & Trends** – Communicating insights:
   - Distribution of sentiments and subjectivity  
   - Word clouds and bar plots of common phrases  
   - Review and sentiment trends over time  

5. **Conclusion** – Final insights and business recommendations
